About This Project
********************
scorediff uses the music21 toolkit to compare scores written in the musicxml format in a variety of ways.  For more information about the specific comparisons supported, have a look at the documentation.

This tool could be used to compare different musicxml versions of a piece of music, as well as for comparing two completely different pieces.

Plans For The Future
=====================
Additional comparisons will likely be added to those currently supported in future versions.
