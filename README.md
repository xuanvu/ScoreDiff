# ScoreDiff #

The goal of this project is to create a simple python tool that can be used to compare two music scores.  

The code will rely on the music21 toolkit, which you can read about and download here: [music21](http://mit.edu/music21/ "music21")

The documentation for this project can be found at: [documentation](www.cs.usfca.edu/~jdubeau/documentation "documentation")

More will be added to the documentation soon, including plans for expanding on this project.
