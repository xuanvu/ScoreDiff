This directory contains the main module of this project, the ScoreDiff.py
module, as well as a test.py script with unit tests, a debug.log file if you enable debug output, and some tools for building the documentation.  You should add in the following directories before building:

_build</br>
_static</br>
_templates</br>

Once those are added, you can run

make html</br>
or
make latexpdf</br>

depending on your preferred output format
