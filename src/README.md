This directory contains the main module of this project, the scorediff.py
module, as well as a test.py script with unit tests, a debug.log file if you enable debug output, and some tools for building the documentation.  You should add in the following directories before building:

_build  
_static  
_templates  


Once those are added, you can run

make html  
or  
make latexpdf  


depending on your preferred output format  
  
You will also need sphinx
